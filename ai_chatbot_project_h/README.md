# ðŸ¤– AI Chatbot with Memory (Python + OpenAI API)

A simple Python chatbot with memory using OpenAI's API. This code can be cloned and run locally by others.

## Features

- Chat with an AI based on OpenAI GPT models  
- Simple memory that remembers previous messages  
- Easy to set up and run locally  

## How to run

1. **Download the project**  
   Clone or download the repo to your own computer.

2. **Install dependencies**  
   Install Python libraries such as `openai` and `python-dotenv`.

3. **Get your OpenAI API key**  
   Visit OpenAI's website and get your own API key.

4. **Create a `.env` file**  
   Create a file named `.env` in the project folder and write your API key inside.

5. **Run the chatbot**  
   Start the Python program and start chatting with the AI in your terminal. Type `exit` to quit.

## Important to remember

- The `.env` file containing the API key **should NOT** be committed to the GitHub repo, as it contains sensitive information.  
- Anyone who downloads the code must create their own `.env` file with their own API key for the chatbot to work.
